A friend has asked you how to set up a GitHub web page in RStudio. Create an Rmarkdown file that explains the steps of setting one up and any troubleshooting advice you learned that could help them. Make as clear and helpful a document as you can, including any links, notes, or pictures that you deem appropriate.

Knit your Rmd file to html and post a link to your Guide on your portfolio page.

First you'll need to download git to your computer. I have a windows computer and found this to be fairly straightforward following the link [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Macs, however, require a little bit more troubleshooting, requiring [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to download [homebrew](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download git. 

Second, you'll need to generate a personal access token to link git and R. 

Once R and git are linked, then you can start to actually build a web page. You'll need to create and r markdown file named 'index' that will serve as the pages main hub.

You'll need to then 'push' the change through into git. To do this, go into the terminal and add the changes. You should use the command 'git add -A' to add all the changes to the commit. Use 'git commit -am [message]' to commit the changes and briefly explain what changes were made. The final command is 'git push'.

'git status' will tell you where the files and changes are.

Finally, you'll want to go into the settings of your repository to upload the web page. Under "Code and automation," there's a section called 'Pages.' In that section, change the Branch from 'none' to 'main.'
